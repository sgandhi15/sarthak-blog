# Sarthak's Site 📝

![AstroPaper](public/astropaper-og.jpg)

Welcome to my personal site where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights about software development. This site serves as a platform for me to document my journey in tech and share knowledge with the developer community.

## About This Site

This site is built using the AstroPaper theme - a minimal, responsive, and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. I chose this theme for its clean design, accessibility features, and excellent performance. The original theme was created by [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev/blog) and you can find more details about it [here](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).
