This is my personal blog where I share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge about web development, programming, and technology. The blog is built using:

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator that allows for component-based development
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and better developer experience
- **Markdown**: For content authoring

The blog features:

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Dark mode support
- SEO optimization
- Fast loading times
- Clean and modern UI
- Tag-based organization
- RSS feed support
